But after some months, he/she realizes that he cannot match up his level in that field and anyhow he/she has to continue in that field and his career downfall start from that point.
 Suppose he wants to go in Genetic research field but he has taken Math stream in  class 11th and 12thand later he/she has no chance to go in that field and students are left with nothing but regret of the fact that he/she should have taken some good career counseling at the beginning.
